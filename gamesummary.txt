create a single page HTML/css/javascript game, with the following requirements:

Purpose:
To show a string of numerical digits and ask user to repeat, to test ability to memorize the digits

Technology:
- Generate a single page html files
- Generate the appropriate css
- Create the core logic in javascript and put it in a javascript file
- Browser compatibility: game should be compatible with all modern browsers
- Device compatibility: Game should be compatible with modern computer OSes (Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac, Linux)
- Mobile device compatibility: Game should be compatible with running in the browser on ios and android (iphone, ipad, android phones and android tablets)
- Write clean and concise code

Rules and gameplay:
  - Initially, start with displaying 6-digit numbers as the current length
  - Generate a random number of the current length and display the number in big font (say, size 20) for 2.5 seconds. Let's call this the question, or, the number to memorize
  - Then have a 0.5 second pause with the number hidden
  - Then ask the user for the number. Let's call this the answer. 
  - Check that the number of digits in the answer matches the current length. If not, display a message and ask for the number again
  - If the number entered matches what was asked, then the answer is correct - display a green checkmark with the word "Correct!" for 1 second, and increase score by one
  - If the number entered does not match what was asked, then display a red X with the word "Wrong!" and show the correct answer along with the answer the user entered. Decrease score by one. Display the result for 1 second and move on to the next round automatically
  - When diplaying the question, group the digits this way:
    - when displaying 6-digit numbers, show as two groups of three (e.g., 123 456)
    - when displaying 7-digit numbers, show as two groups, one of three and one of four (e.g., 123 4567)
    - when displaying 8-digit numbers, show as two groups of four (e.g., 1234 5678)
    - when displaying 9-digit numbers, show as three groups of three (e.g., 123 456 789)
    - when displaying 10-digit numbers, show as two groups of three and one group of four (e.g., 123 456 7890)
    - for numbers with more than 10 digits, display in groups of 4 and the last group contains the remaining digits

Score keeping:
  - Score starts at zero
  - Score can not go below zero. If score becomes negative, set it to zero
  - Every time user gets the answer correctly, one is added to the score
  - Every time user get answer wrong, one is subtracted from the score
  - Display current score on the top right of the window
   
Level up/down:
 - At the beginning of the game start with 6-digit numbers as the current length
 - If the score is between 0 and 4, the number of digits (current length) in the question is 6
 - When score gets to 5, set the number of digits (current length) to 7
 - For every 7-point increase in score, increase the number of digits (current length) by 1 (e.g., when score gets to 12, set the number of digits (current length) to 8, and so on)
 - for every 5-point decrease in score, decrease the number of digits (current length) by 1
 - change duration the question is displayed. Start with 2.5 seconds for the 6-digit number. 
 - For every additional digit, increase the duration by 0.5 seconds. e.g., when the question is 7-digits, the duration shoud be 3 seconds. When the question is 8 digits, the duration should be 3.5 seconds, etc. 
 - Duration shoud change with the number of digits as game levels up and levels down.

UI:
  - Keep the UI clean with a plain and light color background
  - Display the name of the game (Number Memory) at the top
  - Ask the questions and ask for answers in the middle of the page
  - Display the current score at top right
  - When doing level up or level down, display the text "level up" or "level down" briefly near the score
